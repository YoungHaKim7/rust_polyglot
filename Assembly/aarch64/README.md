## HelloSilicon

An introduction to assembly on Apple Silicon Macs.

## Introduction

In this repository, I will code along with the book Programming with 64-Bit ARM Assembly Language, adjusting all sample code for Apple's ARM64 line of computers. While Apple's marketing material seems to avoid a name for the platform and talks only about the M1 processor, the developer documentation uses the term "Apple Silicon". I will use this term in the following.

The original sourcecode can be found here.
