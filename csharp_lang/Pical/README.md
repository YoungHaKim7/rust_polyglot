## .NET Core parallel computation of PI


# The sample source code is a .NET Core Console application written in C#, that estimates the value of PI using a variety of both serial and parallel implementations. The sample demonstrates elapsed time comparisons between serial execution and parallel functional equivalents. The parallel implementations make use of PLINQ and the Parallel class
